## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Storage Model Support**: Introduced full support for battery storage components (`EnergyReservoirStorage`).
- **Bi-directional Bidding**: Added automated handling of both generation ("GEN") and load ("LOAD") market bids for storage units.
- **New Documentation**: Added a comprehensive "Clearing with Batteries" example (`docs/src/examples/clearing-with-batteries.md`).
- **Decremental Cost Curves**: Added support for concave decremental variable cost curves derived from load bids.

### Changed

- **Parser Refactoring**: Significant overhaul of `set_market_bids!` in `src/parser.jl` to handle storage components separately from standard generators.
- **Bid Extraction Logic**: Improved `PiecewiseStepData` extraction to correctly handle the directionality of bids.
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated multiple existing examples (`economic_dispatch.md`, `market_bids.md`, `interchanges.md`) to reflect the new storage model capabilities.

### Fixed

- **Storage Capacity Scaling**: Fixed an issue where storage capacity was not correctly scaled by `base_power` during component addition in `region_model.jl`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- New project roadmap documentation (`docs/src/roadmap.md`).

### Changed

- **CI/CD Overhaul**: Streamlined GitHub Actions workflows, merging test and CI scripts into a unified `Test.yml`.
- **Quality Control**: Add hooks to `pre-commit` for automated linting and formatting.
- **Documentation**: Cleanup of examples, fixing typos, and improving cross-linking.
- **Project Structure**: Removed deprecated `geoutils.jl` and simplified `Project.toml` dependencies.

### Fixed

- Link duplication and typos in documentation examples (#44).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Mock Testing Framework**: Introduced `test/mock_data.jl` for generating Hive-partitioned Parquet datasets, enabling offline and fast testing.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added extensive unit tests for `RegionModel`, `DataReader`, and time-series setters.
- **New Examples**: Added "Gathering Data" example documentation.
- **Cloud Support**: Enhanced database reader and parsers for better compatibility with cloud storage (S3/GCS) and Hive-partitioned layouts.

### Changed

- **Licensing**: Formalized the project under the BSD 3-Clause license.
- **Interconnector Logic**: Refactored `region_model.jl` to correctly handle interconnector constraints and directionality.

### Fixed

- Bug in interface definitions and interchange examples (#42).
- Date range ceiling and boundary issues in data parsers (#38).
- Various minor fixes in `parser.jl` for 5-minute vs 30-minute resolution handling.
